* Try to stick to using single quotes for string, except in cases where using double quotes is more readable 
* If you need to import lots of names from a module or package, and they wonâ€™t all fit in one line (without making the line too long), then use parentheses to spread the names across multiple lines.
* Use [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) to check Python code style.
