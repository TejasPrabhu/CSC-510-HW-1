|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 2 | I observed the [work division](https://github.com/arnab-95/se-group38-hw/graphs/contributors) and observed few members worked on more lines of code than others. Also some pople commited heavily till Sept 11 and for others the contribution was less.|
