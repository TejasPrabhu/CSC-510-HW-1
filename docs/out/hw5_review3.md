|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 3 | I analysed the [work division](https://github.com/ekanshsinghal/se-hw2-fall22/graphs/contributors) and observed that the workload has been distributed evenly among the members and significant commits and changes have been made.   |
|Number of commits|3| A total of 104 commits has been made.|
|Number of commits: by different people| 2 | Few team members have less commits |
|Issues reports: there are **many**| 0 | No issues reported.|
|Issues are being closed| 0 | No issues reported and closed. |
|DOI badge: exists|3| Badge exists.|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 3 | Contains the necessary documents to understand the project. |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 0 | very little to no documentation. |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 0 | very little to no documentation. |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 0 | very little to no documentation. |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|  0 | very little to no documentation. |
|Use of version control tools| 1 | Github was used. Only 2 branches visible.|
|Use of style checkers | 3 | flake8 used in build.yml |
|Use of code formatters. | 3 | flake8 used in build.yml |
|Use of syntax checkers. | 3 | flake8 used in build.yml |
|Use of code coverage | 0 | The code coverage not implemented. |
|Other automated analysis tools| 0 | No automated analysis tools. |
|Test cases exist| 3 | [tests](https://github.com/ShiveshJha12/SE_group28_HW2/tree/main/test)
|Test cases are routinely executed| 2 | The test cases are being executed inside actions but through pytest not through a custom test engine. |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 1 | [file]https://github.com/ShiveshJha12/SE_group28_HW2/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) Precise intructions for contributing can be added.
|Issues are discussed before they are closed| 0 | No issues created.
|Chat channel: exists| 0 | No chat channel link provided. |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3| Looking at the history of commits the team has handled this well |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| N/A |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3 |
|Short release cycles | N/A |
