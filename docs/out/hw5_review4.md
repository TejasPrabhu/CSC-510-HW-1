|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| 2 | I observed the [work division](https://github.com/kartikson1/Group3-CSC510-HW2345/graphs/contributors) and obserbed few members contributed less compared to others.   |

|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 0 | No documentation. |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 0 | No documentation. |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|  0 | No documentation. |
